            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Learned World having been for ſome years in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a Deſcription of the Antiquities of <hi>Palmyra</hi> from ſome accurate Traveller, whoſe Curioſity might prompt him to viſit thoſe Deſarts, that he might enrich <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> with the Rarities of that remote Province of the Eaſt, of which the World had had but a very obſcure, if any, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſome worthy Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, purſuant to the Dictates of that nobler Genius, that actuates the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Members of the <hi>Levant</hi> Company, overlookt all the Difficulties and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, that accompany ſuch an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and attempted the Diſcovery. And though the firſt Eſſay was not crown'd with ſo good Succeſs, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, through the Treachery and Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Arab</hi> Prince, who at that
<pb facs="tcp:63654:4"/>time govern'd the Country; the ſecond Voyage was perform'd to the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Mankind, and 'tis to their Munificence, that we owe thoſe Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſht. Nor is this the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, wherein thoſe eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants have been Benefactors to the Commonwealth of Letters; their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany conſiſting of Men of good Birth, and gentile Education, of liberal For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and as large Minds; and may their Succeſs in their worldly Affairs be ſuited to their great Deſerts, may they always flouriſh, and always be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to do worthy Actions.</p>
            <p>To the jealous <hi>Arabs</hi> the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſeem'd ridiculous, that prudent Men ſhould contract a great Expence only to tranſcribe a few imperfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and take a view of old Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, and perhaps there are ſome Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors who live nearer than the Deſarts of <hi>Tadhmur,</hi> who are of the ſame opinion; but the Men of Judgment in all Ages have entertained different Sentiments, and Providence ſeems to have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concern'd in the Preſervation
<pb facs="tcp:63654:4"/>of many Fragments of Antique Litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. When

               <hi>Strabo</hi> treats of <hi>Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Greece, which had been utterly deſtroy'd before his time, inſomuch as whoſoever travel'd thoſe parts, might juſtly queſtion whither ever thoſe places had been inhabited;</hi> he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, <hi>that the Curious and Inquiſitive were pleas'd to viſit thoſe Ruines, being deſirous to ſee the Theatres, where ſo many noble Actions had been perform'd, and to pay Homage to the Aſhes of thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons, who lay there buried:</hi> (And what a Spirit of Emulation does it raiſe in every generous Soul to prompt him to ſublime Actions, when he views the Tombs, or hears the Story of the Heroes of former Ages?) And in the days of
<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ront.</note> 
               <hi>Lucian, when many Cities had been ſwallowed up of Earthquakes, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Sea, tho' Rivers themſelves had been loſt, and abſorpt, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more appear'd, yet the Tomb of</hi> Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus <hi>was preſerv'd at</hi> Argos, <hi>a Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Atchievements of that firſt King of the</hi> Morea.</p>
            <p>Neither <hi>Strabo,</hi> nor <hi>Mela,</hi> take any notice of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> nor (which is more to be admired) many of the Arabian
<pb facs="tcp:63654:5"/>Geographers, neither <hi>Alferganus,</hi> nor the Geographer commonly called the <hi>Nubian,</hi> neither <hi>Naſſer Eddin</hi> nor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lug Beig,</hi> ſet out by our Learned Mr. <hi>Greaves;</hi> its Situation was very remote from both <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> in the midſt of vaſt Deſarts, which deter'd the curious Traveller; and its Empire, and Glory were ſo ſhort-lived, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect a large Deſcription of its State and Fortunes from the ancient Writers. But ſuch Memorials, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, or the later Hiſtorians have afforded, I have taken care to digeſt into method, and to offer them to the preſent Age. Had we <hi>Domninus</hi> the Hiſtorian of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived in the Neighbourhood, or <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> or <hi>Nicoſtratus</hi> of <hi>Trebizond,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of thoſe times, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Affairs of the Eaſt, it would have been no difficult Province to have given a more perfect account of that Country; or had we but that one Oration of the moſt accurate <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi> which he wrote in praiſe of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daenathus,</hi> that no doubt would have furniſht a ſufficient ſtock of Materials toward the writing the Life of that
<pb facs="tcp:63654:5"/>Great Man; but theſe are Bleſſings loſt to the World, and, I fear, paſt retrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>It may look like a bold, and daring Undertaking, to adventure to build a Large Structure with ſo few Materials; but I have been as careful in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as I was qualified to be, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Underſtanding have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd my ſelf to the ſtrict Rules of Truth, and exactly followed my Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, (whom for that reaſon I have ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Margin;) for he, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to write Hiſtory without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, may be ſaid to be Author of a Romance, or a Collector of Dreams, but can never be allowed to be a good Hiſtorian. And if I have been, as I take it for granted, miſtaken in any of my Conjectures, (as I have frequently taken that liberty, but no where, that I know of, without ſome grounds for my ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) it is no wonder, and will be eaſily pardoned, when 'tis conſider'd, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Hiſtorians of that Country, and of the early Ages, knew not all the particulars of the <hi>Palmyrene</hi> Affairs; that <hi>Theodorit</hi> himſelf the Biſhop of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:63654:6"/>in <hi>Cyrrheſtica,</hi> a Neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, in leſs than two hundred years after the Reign of <hi>Odaenathus,</hi> is ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, as to affirm, that <hi>Zenobia</hi> was conſtituted the Toparch of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> after they had routed the Romans, and that he, who digs in a dark Mine, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a little failure in his Work; and I ſhall thank any Learned Man, who ſhall correct my Errors, and ſet the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in a better light.</p>
            <p>I have dealt with my Reader, as I love to be treated my ſelf, having been always pleaſed with a full account of whatever is material on any ſubject, when profeſtly handled; and I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my Authorities in the Margin, not to make a ſhow of much acquaintance with Books, but to inform the Reader that I have not impoſed on him, and to direct him where he may ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he doubts. I have uſed the words <hi>Palmyra</hi> and <hi>Tadhmur</hi> promiſcuouſly, becauſe, though the new name, whither impoſed by a Conqueror, or given for any other reaſon, prevail'd among the Greeks and Romans, yet the old Syriac

He ſpent all his time in Riot and Luxury, in Wine and Women; never would drink, but out of a Golden Bowl (deſpiſing Glaſs, becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and cheap,) and every time chang'd his Wine: his Concubines ſate at the ſame Table with him; and at the next Table to him, his Buffoons, Paraſites and Jeſters.

She often rode on Horſe-back, commonly in a Chariot, ſeldom was carry'd in a Chair,

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63654:76"/>Wife was the braver of the two; the moſt Couragious, as well as the Faireſt of her Sex. She often arm'd her Head with a Caſque, and as often aſſiſted at her Councils of War; and ſuch an eſteem ſhe had of true Magnanmity, that ſhe told <hi>Aurelian,</hi> That ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Gallienus</hi> and <hi>Aureolus</hi> Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſops, but ſhe eſteem'd him qualify'd to make an Emperor of the World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Stout and Adventurous General. She accompany'd <hi>Odenathus</hi> in all his Expeditions, and was with him when he ſo ſuccesfully attempted the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Perſians,</hi> it muſt be confeſt, uſed to carry their Wives with them into the Field, but rather for Show and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, that they might enjoy the pleaſure of ſeeing a fierce Battle fought, and be exempt from all the Hazards of it; but <hi>Zenobia</hi> went into the Field as a great General, and had her ſhare in the Dangers of the Engagement.</p>
                     <p>And this part of her Auguſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter her Enemy <hi>Aurelian</hi> gave her:
<note place="margin">1b. <hi>p.</hi> 198.</note> For when it was objected to him, That he made a mighty buſtle about a Trifle, when he triumph't over an unfortunate
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63654:76"/>Woman: — He told the Senate, <q>That they knew not the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that Great Lady; That ſhe was Prudent and Politick in her Councils, and Conſtant to her Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; That ſhe had an entire and undiſputed Power over her Army; was very Liberal, when Neceſſity requir'd; and very Sharp, when Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity was requiſite; That it was by her Conduct, that <hi>Odenathus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the <hi>Perſians,</hi> put <hi>Sapores</hi> to flight, and march't to the Walls of <hi>Cteſiphon;</hi> That ſhe made all the <hi>East,</hi> and all <hi>Egypt</hi> tremble, when neither the <hi>Arabs,</hi> nor the <hi>Saracens,</hi> nor the <hi>Armenians</hi> could affright them; and and that he gave her her Life, upon the proſpect that ſuch an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Heroine, who could preſerve and manage the vaſt Empire of the <hi>East</hi> for her ſelf and Children, would be of great Advantage to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and teach the <hi>Romans</hi> the Rules of Conduct and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To make good this Character, and to let the World ſee how well the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Sex might be accompliſht for Rule
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63654:77"/>and Dominion, ſhe told the Emperor, That if ſhe had ſucceeded in her At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ſhe deſign'd to have conſtituted <hi>Victoria,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Victorinus,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brave Lady of that Age (who had made more than one Emperor, and took to her ſelf the Title of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> and is ſtiled in the Coins and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>Mater Caſtrorum</hi>) her Companion in the Royal Dignity, and between them they would have divided the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World.</p>
                     <p>The only Fault which I find her charg'd with (except her Fear, when ſhe fell into the Hands of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> which prompted her to diſcover all her Friends and Aſſiſtants to that cruel Prince, who preſently murther'd them, for in this ſhe fell beneath the Great <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>) was her diſlike of her Son-in-Law <hi>Herodes,</hi> whom <hi>Odenathus</hi> had begotten on a former Wife, and that ſhe conſented to his murther, that the Empire might devolve on her own Sons, <hi>Herennianus</hi> and <hi>Timolaus.</hi> But this is reported by only one Hiſtorian; and I cannot believe, that to rid her hands of a Son-in-Law, ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Parricide of her Husband,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63654:77"/>whom ſhe lov'd ſo dearly, and who ſo well deſerv'd it; for they both fell at the ſame time, and by the ſame Hand. But Diamonds have their Flaws; and the richeſt Metals, ſome Alloy.</p>
                     <p>I have thus endeavoured to ſet this Heroine in a true Light; for it would not have been juſt, to treat a Princeſs of ſuch rare Endowments both of Mind and Body (who was the Ornament of her Sex, and the Wonder of the Age ſhe liv'd in, reverenc'd over all the <hi>East,</hi> and admir'd even at <hi>Rome</hi> by her bittereſt Adverſaries) with a meager and jejune Character, though the beſt Deſcriptions, even of the ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fall below her Merit.

                     <p>Near <hi>Antioch, Zenobia</hi> had fix'd her ſtation, in the Head of a numerous Army advantagiouſly poſted.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63654:82"/>Flight, till the extreme Heat of the Weather, and the Weight of their heavy Arms had tyred them, and forc'd them to deſiſt from the Purſuit. The due Obſervation of this Order got the Victory: For when the <hi>Romans,</hi> by this manner of Fighting, had ſatigued the <hi>Palmyrenian</hi> Troops, and tyred their Horſes, then they charg'd them with the utmoſt Vigour, and as they fell from their Horſes, or their Horſes ſunk under them, trod them under their feet.

                     </p>
                     <p>At this time <hi>Aurelian</hi> was inform'd, that a Party of the <hi>Palmyrenians</hi> had poſted themſelves advantageouſly on a Hill that overlook'd <hi>Daphne,</hi> the famous Suburb of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in confidence that the Steepneſs of the Place would ſecure them from all the Attacks of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> But the Emperor commanded his Infantry to draw themſelves into their Cloſe Order, and to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Shields, ſo to bear off the Darts and Stones that their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries might hurl down upon them: And by this method they got an eaſie
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63654:84"/>Victory, and put all their Enemies to flight; whom the <hi>Romans</hi> purſued ſo cloſely, that ſome were forc'd to throw themſelves off from the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, and ſo were torn in pieces, while the remainder periſh't by the Swords of the Victors.</p>
                     <p>After this, the Cities of <hi>Apamea, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa</hi> and <hi>Arethuſa</hi> open'd their Gates, and ſubmitted to the Conqueror, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him with all the Marks of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63654:85"/>by the <hi>Palmyrenians,</hi> who were ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them in number, and gall'd them very ſeverely, breaking and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering their Ranks. But as they were about to turn their backs, the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot charg'd the Enemy's Troops ſo briskly, that they ſoon put them to flight.

In purſuit of this Deſign, they fell upon <hi>Sandario,</hi> and the Six hundred Archers whom the Emperor had left there in Garriſon, and putting them to the Sword, choſe <hi>Achilleus</hi> (the Father of their Captive Queen <hi>Zenobia</hi>) their Prince. But as ſoon as the Emperor heard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, being a General of unwearied Diligence and Diſpatch, he immediately march'd back into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd that unhappy City.</p>

                     <p>This part of the Story <hi>Zoſimus</hi> tells ſomewhat differently; That the Men of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> inſtigated by <hi>Apſaeus,</hi> who had in former times been a buſie Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator among them, attempted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade <hi>Marcellieus</hi> (<hi>T. Nonnius Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> I ſuppoſe, who afterwards was Conſul in Year of the Emperor <hi>Tacitus, Anno Chriſti</hi> 275,) whom <hi>Aurelian</hi> had conſtituted his Governor of <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> and the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi> to take upon him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He put them off from day to day; and under the pretext of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo weighty an Affair, before he determin'd his Reſolutions, gain'd time till he had certify'd <hi>Aurelian</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt; but at laſt he poſitively refuſed to take the Purple. Whereupon they choſe <hi>Antiochus</hi> their King, and arm'd themſelves in his defence.</p>
                     <p>Upon the News that <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſent, the Emperor doubled his March, and in a ſhort time came to <hi>Antioch;</hi> the Inhabitants, who were buſied about their Sports, in ſeeing the Horſe-races, being ſurpriz'd at his coming; from whence he immediately ſpeeded to <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra,</hi> which without fighting he took,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63654:90"/>and raz'd, giving <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Life and Liberty, accounting him beneath his Anger.</p>
                     <p>In the Sack of the City, the Soldiers were ſurfeited with Blood and Rapine (as <hi>Aurelian,</hi> in his Letters to <hi>Cejonius Baſſus,</hi> relates) ſparing neither Age, Sex nor Quality, involving Women and Children, Old and Young, the Nobility and the Boors in the ſame common Ruine, till there was hardly left a Man to inhabit the City, or to manure the Ground.</p>
                     <p>Such a Revenge ſatiated even the fierce Temper of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> inaſmuch as he he wrote to <hi>Cejonius Baſſus</hi> (or rather <hi>Cerronius,</hi> according to the old Copies, probably the ſame <hi>Cerronius,</hi> the General of the <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Troops, who ſlew <hi>Gallienus,</hi> whom, I conjecture, <hi>Aurelian</hi> left the Governor of <hi>Palmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi>) to put a period to the Carnage, and to ſpare the poor remains of that unfortunate City, enjoyning him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to build the Temple of the <hi>Sun</hi> (which had been ſack't and rifled by the Soldiers of the Third Legion) as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently as it had been in times paſt (and by the Ruines of it extant at this

                     <p>After this, <hi>Aurelian</hi> return'd into <hi>Europe</hi> without any diſturbance, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the unhappy <hi>Zenobia</hi> his Priſoner with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> till ſhe became one of the Ornaments of his Triumph; whither I ſhall follow her, to compleat her Story, when I have briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the Fortunes of her Aſſociate <hi>Firmius.</hi>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63654:95"/>taken, done in exquiſite Imagery and Picture: After theſe followed the Riches of the Conquer'd Provinces, vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Gold and Silver, and noble Gems, Crowns and Royal Robes, and the other Ornaments of Royalty and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, intermix'd with the Arms that were peculiar to the Regions that had been reduc'd under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power: Theſe were ſucceeded, among others, by a long Train of Sacrifices, and Prieſts attending that Service, all clad in rich Garments of Silk and Purple, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wove with Gold: Then came the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of the unfortunate Princes, with a long train of their faithful Subjects, who, to ſhew their Fidelity, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to follow the adverſe Fortune of their Sovereigns.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Aurelian</hi> made his Entry into that ſuperb City, there were three Royal Chariots very remarkable: The firſt belong'd to the Hero <hi>Odenathus,</hi> (while alive) richly adorn'd with Gold, and Silver, and Precious-Stones, which gave it a peculiar Luſtre. The ſecond, no leſs glorious than the firſt, was a Preſent made by the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to the Great <hi>Aurelian,</hi> (who alſo preſented
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63654:95"/>him with a Purple Robe, of ſo beautiful a Dye, dipt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that nothing of the Imperial Wardrobe, or the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it.) The third, was the Chariot which <hi>Zenobia</hi> had cauſed to be made for her ſelf, in hopes to have entred <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, after ſhe had reduced that proud City. 'Tis true, ſhe made her entry into <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſame Chariot; but ſhe rode in it a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, not a Queen.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Chariots were followed by a fourth, which (as it was reported) did once belong to the King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> drawn by four Stags a-breaſt, in which <hi>Aurelian</hi> (clad in the famous Purple above-mentioned, which he afterwards dedicated to <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus,</hi> and which after Ages look'd on with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) was drawn to the Capitol, where he ſacrificed the Stags, according to a Vow made to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> when he took the Chariot. In the head of theſe Chariots march'd twenty Elephants; of <hi>Lybian</hi> Lions,
<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſ. in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſc. pag.</hi> 371.</note> Leopards and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo of thoſe of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> two hundred; which, after the Triumph was ended, <hi>Aurelian</hi> beſtowed on his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63654:96"/>private Friends, that he might leſſen the Publick Expence. Theſe were ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by four Tygars, by ſeveral Camelopardali, Elks, and other ſtrange Beaſts, each in their orders.</p>
                     <p>Part of this Pomp conſiſted of eight hundred pair of Gladiators deſtin'd to the Entertainment of the People, and of an infinite number of Captives; for, beſides the Barbarous Nations of the <hi>Blemmyes,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Axumis,</hi> and of <hi>Arabia the Happy;</hi> the <hi>Indians, Bactrians, Iberians, Saracens</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi> and after them, the <hi>Goths, the Alans,</hi> the <hi>Roxolans,</hi> the <hi>Sarmatians, Franks, Suevians, Vandals</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> with their Hands bound behind their Backs, preceded the Imperial Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. Among theſe, the principal Men of <hi>Palmyra,</hi> as many as had outliv'd the Calamity of their Country, and the Rebels of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had their ſtation. But the moſt remarkable of the Captives were ten Maſculine Women, who, habited in Mens Cloaths, had done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Service to the <hi>Gothick</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; theſe few being all that ſurvived of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Race, who ſought againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> and in the Head
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63654:96"/>of every Nation, was carry'd the Name of the Country to which they belong'd.</p>
                     <p>Amid'ſt this numerous train of Priſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Tetricus</hi> made a peculiar Figure; he was habited <hi>A-la-mode de France,</hi> where he had been Emperor, in a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloak, under which he wore a light Gold-coloured Coat, and a pair of French Breeches; with him was his Son, whom <hi>Tetricus</hi> had declared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in <hi>France.</hi> After him followed <hi>Zenobia,</hi> deck'd to the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but loaden with her Golden Chains, whoſe weight was ſupported by her Attendants. The Crown of every conquer'd City, diſtinguiſh'd by an eminent Inſcription, was carried before every Nation. After them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Banners of the ſeveral Colleges, and the Enſigns of every Regiment, with the Cuiraſſiers, followed by the reſt of the Army. And after theſe the Senators march'd (but not ſo brisk and merry as otherwiſe they would have been on ſuch a Solemnity, becauſe <hi>Tetricus,</hi> who was a Member of that Auguſt Body, was led a Captive in the Triumph.) It was late e're the

                     <p>I Shall not undertake to fix the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Original of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor determine what Creature on this ſide the Higheſt Heaven, which is the Throne of the Great Creator of the World, was the firſt Object of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhip; but I have great reaſon to believe, that when Religious Adoration was firſt transferr'd from the True God, it was given to the Heavenly Bodies, to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> they being the moſt illuſtrious Viſible part of the Creation, and for ought that any Man, the oldeſt in the World, could remember or know (further than Revelation gave him infallible Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) might be, as they have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Unchangeable and Incorruptible in their Nature, ſo Eternal in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they having been made and fix'd in their glorious Spheres, before the firſt Man's Breath was breath'd into his Noſtrils from Above: Whereas the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63654:153"/>older Heathens knew the Pedigree, and the times of the ſeveral Births of their <hi>Saturns</hi> and <hi>Jupiters,</hi> and the whole Race of Gods derived from them; their firſt Books of Heathen Divinity being written upon the Subject of the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi> or the Generation of their Gods.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the Antiquity of their Original, their Uſefulneſs and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the World was another Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Worſhip of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> (and if we examine the late Pretenſions of <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> we ſhall find, that in a great part it proceeded from this Belief, That ſuch and ſuch Perſons having been Benefactors to the World in many uſeful Inventions, they were for thoſe Reaſons, after their deaths, Deify'd and ador'd.) For what greater Bleſſings were the Heathens ſenſible of, than what the <hi>Sun,</hi> and, in a leſs degree, the <hi>Moon</hi> beſtowed, who not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht the Seaſons of the Year (the variety of which are neceſſary to the Productions of the Earth, and the growth of Animals) and regulated the Computations of Time, but gave to all Creatures Health and Vigour, and the Preſervatives of Life; Light, the firſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63654:153"/>Bleſſing the World ever ſaw, and the trueſt Emblem of the Divinity; and Heat, and genial Warmth, to cheriſh and Promote the Eaſe of Mankind, which alſo produc'd all things neceſſary for Life, form'd Minerals in the Bowels of the Earth, and regulated the Motions of the Sea.</p>
                     <p>And when ſome of the moſt ancient of the Eaſtern Sages, finding ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in Nature, which they could not reconcile, agreed to aſſert two Firſt Principles of Good and Evil, yet they choſe the <hi>Sun</hi> to repreſent Both (as a common Agent in both their Names;) becauſe when the <hi>Sun</hi> was in their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, they were Partakers of its Light, and its Heat; but when it retir'd, they were cover'd with Darkneſs (unleſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the <hi>Moon</hi>) becauſe his Influences gave Life, and promoted the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animals, but his Abſence intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Corruption and Death. And to preſerve the remembrance, ſince the <hi>Sun</hi> was not always in view, the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals maintained an Unexſtinguiſht Fire to repreſent it (nothing here below comeing ſo near to the Image of that great Light, as <hi>Fire.</hi>) Nor did thoſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63654:154"/>Sages believe thoſe glorious Planets to be meer Machines fix'd to their Orbs, but, as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> talkt of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, who mov'd thoſe great Bodies, ſo they thought them the Reſidences of the Divinity (the <hi>Senſible Sun</hi> to be the Seat of the <hi>Intellectual Sun.</hi>) And ſo the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who had their two firſt Principles from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Magi, aver'd, that our Bleſſed Saviour dwelt in the <hi>Sun:</hi> And therefore they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Chriſtians of thoſe early Ages, who conſtantly and at all times ador'd toward the <hi>East,</hi> directed their Worſhip toward the <hi>Sun,</hi> in what part ſoever of the Heavens he was, believing that to be the Tabernacle fix'd for our Bleſſed Lord, in which he liv'd and mov'd. And among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (between whom and the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> there was a Diſpute for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority in the Schools of ancient Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they had a Tradition, That the firſt Books of Religious Worſhip were given to them by a Hawk, who brought them to the Prieſts of <hi>Egypt</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Bird the Hawk was, and by which they repreſented that noble Planet; as they did alſo <hi>Venus,</hi> ſays <hi>Horapollo.</hi>
